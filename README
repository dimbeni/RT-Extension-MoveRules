NAME
    RT::Extension::MoveRules - control ticket movements between queues

DESCRIPTION
    If you move tickets between queues a lot then probably you want to
    control this process. This extension allows you to configure rules which
    are required to move a ticket from a queue to another queue, for example
    if custom field X is equal to Y then a ticket can be moved from queue A
    to B. As well you can define which fields should be set before move.

LICENSE
    Under the same terms as perl itself.
